# Summary

### Plot Overview
The plot shows the density distribution of the **median gene expression** values. The data was calculated from gene expression values across multiple samples in the dataset.

### Key Observations

1. **Peak near Zero Expression**:
   - There is a significant spike in the distribution near **0** on the log2 scale, indicating that a large portion of the genes have low to very low median expression across the samples. This could represent genes that are either not expressed or have very low expression in the studied conditions.

2. **Secondary Peak around 1-2 (log2 scale)**:
   - A smaller peak appears around log2 values of **1-2**, indicating a subset of genes with moderate expression levels.

3. **Long Tail of High Expression**:
   - The right side of the distribution shows a **long tail**, which suggests that a smaller fraction of genes exhibit high levels of expression, with a gradual decrease as the expression levels increase.
